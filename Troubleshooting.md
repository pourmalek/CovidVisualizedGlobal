## Troubleshooting


Once you have started executing the downloaded "do globalcovid master.do" that is expected to be located in your local machine's "Users|local-user-name|Downloads|globalcovid-main|20210428|code|master|do globalcovid master.do" (for update 20210428), Stata may return *ERRORs*, or may *RESTART*. The following are among possible causes and treatments. | denotes / or \ for Mac or Windows respectively. 
<br/><br/>

### KNOWN ISSUES

<br/><br/>

********************************************************************************************************************************************
* **Problem** (1): If the *ERROR* message is about file path or directory clash, e.g., the error message reads as, -unable to change to (some directory name)-. 

* **Treatment**: Make sure the file path to "do globalcovid master.do" on the local machine is: 

"Users/local-user-name/Downloads/globalcovid-main/20210428/code/master/do globalcovid master.do"  [for Mac]  for update 20210428; and later instances of 202YMMDD for later updates. 

"C:Users\local-user-name\Downloads\globalcovid-main\20210428\code\master\do globalcovid master.do" [for Windows] for update 20210428; and later instances of 202YMMDD for later updates. 

Manually rearrange the directories so that the expected file path leading to "do globalcovid master.do" reads as mentioned above. 
<br/><br/>
This code is set up to work from "|Users|local-user-name|Downloads|202YMMDD|code|master|do globalcovid master.do". Sometimes users chose destinations other than |Downloads| folder. Before editing the code, it will not work from anywhere else.
<br/><br/>
Sometime, if the downloaded zip file is unzipped manually (in Windows), there might be a possibility that the file path is not identical to the correct path, that is created after auto-inflation of the zip file and shown above. In any case, rearrange the directories so that the expected file path mentioned above leads to "do globalcovid master.do"  

A relatively frequent problem with unzipping in Windows is that the file path might become something like:

"C:\Users\local-user-name\Downloads\globalcovid-main\globalcovid-main\20210428\code\master\do globalcovid master.do"




Note: |202YMMDD| updates an be similary used instead of |20210428| update. Run "|Users|local-user-name|Downloads|globalcovid-main|202YMMDD|code|master|do globalcovid master.do" on local machine for the future 202YMMDD updates.

********************************************************************************************************************************************
* **Problem** (2): If the *ERROR* message is about unavailability / unresponsiveness of a component study site server, or less frequently, web server unresponsiveness might occur during downloading `-renvars-` Stata command. For instance, the error message might be -r(691); I/O error- that is usually an internet connection issue. See -r(691) I/O error- on [statalist](https://www.statalist.org/forums/forum/general-stata-discussion/general/1475517-update-all-r-691-i-o-error). For other errors regarding connecting to the Internet from within Stata, e.g., error -r(610);- see Stata [common-connection-error-messages](https://www.stata.com/support/faqs/web/common-connection-error-messages/)

* Intermittent good and bad internet connection: 
In cases where one or more component study files have been downloaded but then the internet connection fails to download a next component study file in the row of files to be downloaded, see _(4) Palliative treatment_  below.

* **Treatment**: (1) Close all running programs / applications except Stata and try again. (2) Try a better internet connection. (3) Try again later. 
Unresponsiveness of a component study site server (or `-renvars-` ) should be temporary, and is usually resolved in about a day. In the meanwhile, one can check the previously created results in [`20210428/output/merge/`](https://github.com/pourmalek/globalcovid/tree/main/20210428/output/merge) or later outputs in [202YMMDD/output/merge/]. _(4) Palliative treatment_ for Intermittent good and bad internet connection: one can -// comment out- the code lines that read from internet and the files have already been successfully downloaded and then rerun the code. 

<br/><br/>

********************************************************************************************************************************************
* **Problem** (3): Stata spontaneously *RESTARTs* and shows start logo - on a local machine using Mac OS Big Sur - this is due to a change in behavior in Big Sur, not a bug in Stata.

* **Treatment**: (1) Quit all other open applications / programs until Stata runs the codes and the last output, that is "log global merge.smcl" is shown up. Even better: Restarting the local machine (to empty the cache), invoking no program, and running the code can be more efficient than running the code on the local machine even with closing all running programs. (2) Provide more memory available for older Statas: In older versions of Stata, manually set a higher memory, e.g., `-set mem 1000m`-. In modern Statas, memory is no longer needed to be manually set, as memory adjustments are automatically performed.
<br/><br/>

********************************************************************************************************************************************
* **Problem** (4): With less expected frequency, your local machine (OS) might stop responding or *RESTART*, due to oversaturation of RAM, CPU. Fan noise might be heard. 

* **Treatment**: (1) If this happens during running the code while all programs except Stata and the web browser are NOT already closed, you may want to retry after all other programs and applications except `Stata` and the web browser are closed. (2) If this happens during running the code while all programs except Stata and the web browser ARE closed, the RAM and CPU of the local machine cannot afford running the code. You may want to try running the code on another computer with better RAM, CPU.
